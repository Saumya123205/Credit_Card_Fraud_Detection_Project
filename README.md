# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Project
## ✅ Objective:

 ### To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify and detect fraudulent transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset using real-world financial data.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used:

 ### Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Data Preprocessing, Imbalanced Data Handling (Under-sampling), Accuracy Evaluation

## 📊 Key Steps & Insights:

## 🔍 Data Understanding:

### 📂 Loaded a dataset of 284,807 transactions, only 492 of which were fraudulent, highlighting severe class imbalance.
### ✅ Verified no missing values, ensuring data quality.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### 🧮 Performed statistical analysis and .describe() summary.
### 📈 Found significant differences in feature distributions between fraud and legit transactions.

## ⚖️ Handling Imbalance:

### 🔁 Applied under-sampling to create a balanced dataset with equal counts of fraud (1) and legit (0) transactions (492 each).

## 🧠 Model Development:

### 🧪 Split balanced data into training and testing sets.
### 🤖 Trained a Logistic Regression model to perform binary classification.

## 📈 Model Evaluation:

### 📊 Achieved 95.5% accuracy on training data and 93.4% accuracy on testing data.
### 📉 Demonstrated effective generalization and robustness.

## 📈 Outcome:
### ✅ This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied in the finance domain to combat fraud, protect users, and optimize risk management systems.
